# BostonVRDataViz
Using Google Daydream and Unity. Work in Progress.

Navigate a 3D model of Boston in VR using Google Daydream, available on most of the newer Android devices and Google Pixels.
Future features would include an overlay/heatmap of different sets of data provided by the city of Boston, such as:
  - Traffic Congestion
  - Potential Flooding areas
  - Crime Map

Due to the limitations of the phones that use Google Daydream, I hope to port this project to a more heavy-duty VR device, such as 
an Oculus or a Vive.
